## I. Introduction üç£ üçõ üçú
- Danny seriously loves Japanese food so in the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favourite foods: sushi, curry and ramen.
- Danny‚Äôs Diner is in need of assistance to help the restaurant stay afloat 

## II. Challenges
- The restaurant has captured some very basic data from their few months of operation but have no idea how to use their data to help them run the business.
- Use the data to answer a few simple questions about customers : visiting patterns, how much money they‚Äôve spent; which menu items are their favourite
